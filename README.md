===========

Summer 2014 project for drug-target pathway analysis

This project aims to reveal the relationships among drug-gene-protein chain reactions by examining multiple databases.
This project is a part of Dr. Xie's project, about drug development.


At this point (14 Sep. 2014) the databases are:
DrugBank - http://www.drugbank.ca/
Connectivity Map - https://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/
STITCH - http://stitch.embl.de/
String - http://string-db.org/

Additional databases and uses are:
PubChem - methods in PUGREST.pm access PubChem to get the InChIKeys for drugs
UniProt - Conversions from ENSP IDs to UniProtKB are based on UniProt ID map data



Note: This repository is for Hansaim Lim's project.
