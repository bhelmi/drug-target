This file contains works that are either in process or not initiated.

1. comparison chart for source conditional logics and destination conditional logics
2. get most strict networks based on different conditional sources (source conditional logics)
3. run Dijkstra's shortest path for above networks
4. get gradually less strict set of networks and run shortestpath
5. compare nonrandom and random networks within individual source conditional logic
6. compare number of sources and path lengths within the each randomization condition
