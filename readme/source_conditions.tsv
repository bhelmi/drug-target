This readme file explains the conditional logic for selecting source genes for shortest pathway networks.
As the conditions are not completely independent of each other, some possibilities are excluded.

Conditions
A	: Is drug-target pair listed in DrugBank?
B	: Is drug-target pair listed in STITCH protein chemical links?
C	: Is drug-target action known in DrugBank?
D	: Is drug-target prediction score over 900 in STITCH data above in condition B?

Logic Table
	A	B	C	D	description
1	T	T	T	T	most strict
2	T	T	T	F	strict on DrugBank, mild on STITCH
3	T	T	F	T	strict on STITCH, mild on DrugBank
4	T	T	F	F	mild on both databases, as long as they agree each other
5	T	F	T	F	STITCH excluded, strict on DrugBank
6	T	F	F	F	STITCH excluded, mild on DrugBank
7	F	T	F	T	DrugBank excluded, strict STITCH
8	F	T	F	F	DrugBank excluded, mild STITCH
9	F	F	F	F	void
